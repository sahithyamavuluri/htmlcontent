<h3 id="career">Career</h3>
<p>While jobs and careers both enable us to earn enough money to support ourselves and our families, they do not mean the same thing. It is important to know whether youâ€™re looking for a job or for a career to plan your professional goals.

In this article, we explain the difference between a job and a career, how one can affect the other and how to turn a job into a career.
A job is work you perform to earn money to support your basic needs. It can be a full-time or part-time job and may be short-term. You might earn an hourly wage or a set paycheck rather than a salary with benefits. You might need to learn certain skills connected with that role, but not all jobs require a specialized degree or advanced training.

Companies expect their employees to perform their individual jobs in exchange for regular payment and to be responsible for the duties laid out for them.

You can also define a job as a short- or long-term contract between an employer and a worker. For instance, a company hires a local contractor to complete an office renovation job. They agree upon payment terms, and the job ends once the project is complete.
